# DOTA2 Analysis

This repository is a random collection of little analysis and visualization tools I have written for the game [DOTA2](http://dota2.com).
Do not judge the code, I do this for fun and am more interested in results than code, this is reflected by the cacophony of languages and tools used.

## Reasonably done

These are the things that are done, or at least somewhat useable.

### Deathmaps

The `deathmap/` subfolder contains most of what I used to create this [heatmap of deaths at TI9](http://lb.eyer.be/a/ti9-deathmap.html).
